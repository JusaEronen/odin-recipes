        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds tri-tip roast</li>
            <li>5 gloves garlic, peeled and very thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/3 cup salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup black pepper</li>
            <li>1/3 garlic salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, cut small slits in the top of the roast; insert garlic 
                slices into the slits.
            </li>
            <li>Mix salt, pepper, and garlic salt together in a small bowl; rub all over the tri-tip 
                and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day. Remove tri-tip from the refrigerator 
                about 20 minutes before grilling.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Place the meat directly above the flame to sear the meat and lock in the juices, about 
                5 to 10 minutes per side.
            </li>
            <li>Turn the grill down to medium heat and continue to cook, turning occasionally, for
                another 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
                should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium-rare. Let stand, covered loosely
                with aluminum foil, for 5 minutes before slicing.
            </li>
        </ol>
